Our aim is to simplify development while making it more accessible. SPARKY Xiaotian supports Python and C/C++ as programming languages, is equipped with our proprietary ALL-IN-ACTUATOR, integrating three degrees of freedom in the legs into a single actuator, offering the robot a vast workspace and dexterity. It allows you to assemble and upgrade leg components with just two screws and design and 3D print personalized shells. With its quick-detachable magnetic back cover, connecting your custom hardware peripherals becomes effortless."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"In fact, SPARKY is not just a robot; it's a testament to our philosophy of robotic aesthetics. We adhere to the principle of \"less is more\" in robot design, seamlessly integrating principles of life sciences and technology, and finding balance between functionality and aesthetics. We've utilized mathematical models of real quadruped mammal legs, energy-storing elements imitating real tendons, integrated all sensors and computations into Xiaotian's head resembling the cortex of a brain, connected all actuators to the head like the central nervous system, and used a consistent alloy throughout to enhance product quality. We're delighted to share our vision with you, as HENGBOT is dedicated to leveraging robotics and artificial intelligence technologies to assist humanity in exploring and solving challenges in life sciences. We hope that SPARKY can become your powerful development platform, giving robots the ability to move like real dogs."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"With the constant advancement of technology, the fusion of living organisms and machines is no longer distant.
